      <h1>CPS</h1>
      <p className="intro-paragraph">
      CPS (Cost Per Sale) is a type of affiliate marketing model where businesses pay commissions only when a sale occurs.
       That means you’re not paying for clicks or impressions — you're paying for actual results.
        It's one of the most effective ways to scale eCommerce, SaaS products, digital courses, and more, while keeping your return on investment high and your acquisition costs low.
